# Qi: Javascript 'assisted' CSS.

Allowing present day standards CSS to enter a feature rich and backwards compatible arena. No dependancies.

# How it works

Qi works by parsing the CSS file(s) with builtin javascript functions and executing changes through the library.

# To use:

1. Include the file.

`<script src="http://qi.kamris.ca/latest.js" />`

2. Adjust your CSS:

`.class:hover, .class:click { background-color:blue; }`
